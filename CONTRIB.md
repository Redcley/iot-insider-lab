#Contributing 

We use a fairly standard branching strategy for demo projects and small teams.

## Inside the team

Once you have been added as a contributor, you will no longer need your own fork of the repository. Instead just create a branch off of master using your first name followed by a slash then a descriptive name for your branch.

```
git checkout -b Sean/xamarin-device
```

Then ```git add```, ```git commit``` and ```git push``` as you do your work. When you are ready for a review. Go to [github](https://github.com) select your branch and click "New Pull Request"

## Outside the team

Create a fork of the repository into your own github account and then ```git add```, ```git commit``` and ```git push``` directly into master. When you are finished, go to [github](https://github.com) and navigate to your fork and click "New Pull Request" to create a pull request.
