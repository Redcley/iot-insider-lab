# IoT Insider Lab

Here is our digital closet of projects, notes, docs and so forth.

## Machine Configuration Notes

The tool chain for IoT can be daunting. Here are some notes of common packages and tools that are useful for developers

* [Windows](machine-config/windows-dev-env.md) as a development platform
* [Mac](machine-config/mac-dev-env.md) as a development platform
* [Linux](machine-config/linux-server.md) as a server

## Lab Notes

We have a lot of machines in the IoT Lab. Here is a place to keep and share notes as we become experts at prototype fabrication.
